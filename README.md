         I am Richard Michael Powell III, but I go by my middle name, Michael. I am currently a first year student at the 
         University of Virginia (UVA), studying mathematics, economics, and computer science, and recently graduated 
         from the Greenwich Country Day School as one of the top of my class in 2023.

         My website contains a personal biography in order to give more insight into who I am, what I have accomplished, 
         and what I should pursue in the future. In a way, the website is a method for me to understand my current skillset
         and what needs improvement in order to satisfy my dreams and aspirations.

         Note that this is a rough draft of the website; I am still learning how to code in HTML.
